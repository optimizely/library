# Google Analytics Integration for Performance Edge
## Overview
1. Instead of passing data through a custom dimension like X Web, we use GA events.  Specifically, we populate eventCategory, eventAction, and eventLabel with data specific to your Optimizely experiments. Here's some output from the [GA Debugger Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) that is logged when the Optimizely Experiment activation event is fired.

2. In GA, you can now filter your users by those who have fired an event with the Action, Category, and/or Labels above.  The label is (experimentId: variationId) and we'll send an event for each active experiment on a given page.

3. You can find the IDs for each of your experiments and variations by looking at the [API Names](https://help.optimizely.com/Troubleshoot_Problems/API_Names%3A_Find_masked_IDs_for_troubleshooting) in the Optimizely App.

*Note: The integration could be modified to include readable names if you are willing to [un-mask descriptive names](https://help.optimizely.com/Classic/Project_Settings%3A_Privacy_in_Optimizely_Classic#Masking_Descriptive_Names).*

## Project JS Code
In projectjs.js, there are areas that will need to be configured per site.
Line # | Configuration
------------ | -------------
18| `{YOUR_DOMAIN}`
82 | `var prefix = '{custom_tracker}' + '.'; // Assign to ‘’ if no custom tracker`
87 | `// Needs to be customized for specific websites. Defines how we identify if GA is available`
